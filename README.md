# Imbalanced data problem
This project is being developed as part of the "Machine Learning" course.

This repository contains the full code for a comparative study of generative methods used for oversampling, including GAN, VAE, DCGAN (CNNGAN) and DCVAE (CNNVAE) methods. The goal is to evaluate the impact of these methods when it comes to generating syntethic samples for ResNet34 classifier and to analyze various dataset scenarios.

## ðŸ§  Generative Methods

- **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)**
- **VAE (Variational Auto Encoder))**
- **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)**
- **DCVAE (Deep Convolutional Variational Auto Encoder))**

Samples generated by these methods were then used by ResNet34 classifier.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buyablemos/ImbalancedDatasetProblem.git
cd ImbalancedDatasetProblem
```

2. **Install required packages**
   
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Experiments

1. Preprocessing and Data Loading
Dataset is loaded via `kagglehub` and then transformed using classes from `DatasetClasses.py`.

2. Training and Evaluation
The core training and evaluation logic (with k-fold cross-validation) is inside `new_research.ipynb`. Simply run the notebook to:
  - Train a ResNet34 classifier (the generative methods are trained within),
  - Evaluate with F2-score, balanced accuracy, recall and specificity.

4. Analyze and Visualize Results
Scripts in the `statistical_analysis.ipynb` perform statistical analysis and generate comparative plots (e.g., bar charts, box plots, metric tables).
